These minerals come in various shades (red, blue, green, white, black, and others) caused by the addition of iron, chromium, manganese, and other heavy metals. White opals, also called milky opals, are most commonly found in nature. They are characterised by opalescence, which gives a mystical spectrum of colours. Due to this property, white opals are most often used to produce luxury jewellery (rings, piercings). Having milk opal, you will invite your angels to be by your side and guard you. It gives hope, optimism and the desire to live and increases joy. It also cleanses and balances the chakras, ensuring that their energies merge with the body.",
